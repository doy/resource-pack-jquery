=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=cut

=head2 version

The desired jQuery version. Required, if C<use_bundled> is false.

=cut

has version => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => 'Str',
);

=head2 minified

Whether or not the Javascript should be minified. Defaults to true.

=cut

has minified => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => 'Bool',
    default => 1,
);

=head2 use_bundled

If true, uses the bundled copy of jquery-1.4.2.min.js that is shipped with
this dist (and ignores the other attributes). Otherwise, uses the values of
C<version> and C<minified> to download a copy of the library from
L<http://code.jquery.com/>.

=cut

has use_bundled => (
    is      => 'ro',
    isa     => 'Bool',
    default => 0,
);

has '+name' => (default => 'jquery');

sub _jquery_url {
    my $self = shift;
    return 'http://code.jquery.com/jquery-'
         . $self->version
         . ($self->minified ? '.min' : '')
         . '.js';
}

sub BUILD {
    my $self = shift;

    if (!defined($self->version) && !$self->use_bundled) {
        confess "version must be specified if use_bundled is false";
    }

        install_from(Path::Class::Dir->new(__FILE__)->parent);

        }
